# LESID

## Introduction

LESID (Light Echo Spectral Identification) is a python tool developed to identify the type of the source of light echoes using distance metric and cross-correlation techniques. Light echoes, caused by the scattering of light off intervening dust clouds, can provide valuable information about the historical light emissions of celestial objects. By comparing light echo spectra with a library of light echo spectral templates, LESID aims to classify and identify the origin of the light echo, such as supernovae, novae, variable stars or other astronomical transients.
